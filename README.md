# Closer-to-origin-point3d-
Define a structure called point3d that encapsulates values for x, y, and z coordinates of a point and following functions:  
- a function to display a point3d variable.  
- a function to receive coordinates of a point3d variable from user.  
- a function to compare two point3d variables that returns a negative value if first argument is closer to origin, a positive value if the second argument is closer to origin, zero if both arguments are equidistance to origin, similar to strcmp().  
Test your functions in a program.
